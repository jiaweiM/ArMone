The MS2 format Dta file.

The MS2 file format is used to record MS/MS spectra. A full description of 
 	the MS2 file format may be found in: McDonald,W.H. et al. MS1, MS2, and 
	SQT-three unified, compact, and easily parsed file formats for the storage 
	of shotgun proteomic spectra and identifications. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 
	18, 2162-2168 (2004). 



Header details
Each line in the header must begin with an H. This is followed by a field label, and 
	then a field value, all separated by white space. The field label must be one of 
	the labels listed below, while the field value can be an aribrary string. A typical 
	header is shown below. 

H	CreationDate	2/14/2007 6:19:18 PM
H	Extractor	MakeMS2
H	ExtractorVersion	1.0
H	Comments	MakeMS2 written by Michael J. MacCoss, 2004
H	ExtractorOptions	MS2/MS1

The following field labels must appear in the header: 

Required header field labels Field Label Description 
CreationDate The date and time when the file was created 
Extractor The name of the software used to create the MS2 file 
ExtractorVersion The version number of the Extractor software 
ExtractorOptions The options used in running the extractor software 

The following field labels are optional, and may appear in the header: 

Optional header field labels Field Label Description 
IAnalyzer Name of software used to conduct charge-state independent analysis of the spectra 
IAnalyzerVersion The version number of the IAnalyzer software 
IAnalyzerOptions The options used in running the IAnalyzer software 
DAnalyzer Name of software used to conduct charge-state dependent analysis of the spectra 
DAnalyzerVersion The version number of the DAnalyzer software 
DAnalyzerOptions The options used in running the DAnalyzer software 
SortedBy Name of field use to sort spectra  
InstrumentType The type of mass analyzer used  
Comment Remarks. Multiple comment lines are allowed  
InstrumentSN Serial number of the mass spectrometer used  

Scan details
Each scan begins with a few records listing the parameters describing the spectrum. These lines must begin with S, I, Z, or D. The records are followed by pairs of m/z and intensity values, one pair per line. A fragment of a typical scan is shown below. 

S	10	10	636.34
Z	2	1271.67
187.4 12.5
193.1 19.5
194.3 13.7
198.3 29.8
199.1 12.2
